🛢️ Oil Spill Detection and Impact Mapping in the Niger Delta Using SAR and Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning–based framework for detecting oil spills and mapping their environmental impact using synthetic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A U-Net convolutional neural network is employed for pixel-level oil spill segmentation, with outputs exported to GIS-ready formats (GeoTIFF and Shapefile) for spatial analysis.

📌 Features

Realistic synthetic SAR data generation mimicking Sentinel-1 backscatter behavior

Oil spill simulation based on low-backscatter, smooth surface properties

U-Net deep learning model for oil spill segmentation

Model evaluation using standard classification metrics

GIS export of predicted oil spill impact areas (GeoTIFF & Shapefile)

Fully compatible with QGIS and ArcGIS

🧠 Methodology

Synthetic SAR Generation
Simulates water and oil spill backscatter characteristics observed in SAR imagery.

Deep Learning Segmentation
A U-Net architecture performs pixel-wise classification of oil spill regions.

Impact Mapping
Predicted oil spill masks are converted into georeferenced raster and vector GIS layers.
